👋 Hi, I'm Steven, a software engineer from Toronto 🍁. I enjoy solving complex problems and building software solutions that make a difference.

👨‍💻 My GitHub profile is where I share my projects, experiments, and contributions to the open-source community. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and collaborate with other developers.

⏱️ In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, watching movies, and overanalyzing football (soccer) games. I'm also an avid learner and enjoy attending workshops and conferences to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies.

👉 Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to contact me if you want to collaborate or have any questions!
